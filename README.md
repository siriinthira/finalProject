# SkillsX
SkillsX is an app prototype that combines networking, knowledge-sharing, and personal growth into one seamless experience. 

üöÄ **Project Goals**

* Build a community that helps users connect with people who truly align with their goals and values.
  
* Foster meaningful professional and skill-based relationships

* Create a win-win deal for people to exchange their skills, knowledge, and experience based on their expertise. 

* Enable continuous personal growth through feedback and skill tracking.

* Encourage users to keep profiles updated, rate interaction quality and reflect on their progress.

# üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë How it Works:

**1. Create a Profile:** Start by creating a personal profile that outlines your skills, interests, and background. The more detailed and up-to-date your profile is, the better you‚Äôll connect with others who share similar or complementary expertise.

**2. Search and Connect:** Use the search function to find individuals who match your interests, skills, or career goals. You can easily send a message or start a conversation to explore potential collaboration opportunities or gain advice.

**3. Interact and Rate:** After engaging in a conversation or collaboration, rate the interaction using the star system. Your feedback helps others gauge the quality of connections, while also helping to build your own reputation in the community.

**4. Grow Your Network:** As you engage with others, skillsX recommends more potential connections based on Cosine Similarity. 

**5. Update Your Profile:** Keep your profile up-to-date with your latest achievements, skills, or interests. This allows other users to see your growth and stay current on your expertise.

# Usability Testing

User Story
As a freelance creative strategist and digital marketer, I want to quickly assess whether potential collaborators and projects align with my storytelling approach and quality standards, 
so that I can invest my time in meaningful work and continue building my professional reputation as both a mentor and creator.

- I can filter out low-quality or misaligned projects based on budget, tone, or creative freedom.

- I can clearly showcase my marketing philosophy, campaigns, and mentorship work on my profile.

- I can share tips or insights and receive feedback from the creative community or mentees.

- I can track communication and collaboration history to identify reliable long-term partners.
