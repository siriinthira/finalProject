# SkillsX
SkillsX is an app prototype that combines networking, knowledge-sharing, and personal growth into one seamless experience. 

üöÄ **Project Goals**

These goals guide what the product aims to achieve in the market and for its users.

Foster meaningful professional and skill-based relationships

Build a community that helps users connect with people who truly align with their goals and values.

Bridge the mentorship gap for students and early-career professionals

Make it easy for emerging talent to connect with experienced mentors.

Create a trusted space for self-improvement and feedback

Support users in developing soft skills and self-awareness through peer feedback.

Enable continuous personal growth through skill tracking

Encourage users to keep profiles updated and reflect on their progress.

Differentiate from traditional networking apps

Provide real value through relevance, interaction quality, and discovery of non-mainstream skills.

Leverage AI (e.g., Cosine Similarity) to improve user experience

Use intelligent matching to surface meaningful connections without overwhelming the user.

# üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë How it Works:

**1. Create a Profile:** Start by creating a personal profile that outlines your skills, interests, and background. The more detailed and up-to-date your profile is, the better you‚Äôll connect with others who share similar or complementary expertise.

**2. Search and Connect:** Use the search function to find individuals who match your interests, skills, or career goals. You can easily send a message or start a conversation to explore potential collaboration opportunities or gain advice.

**3. Interact and Rate:** After engaging in a conversation or collaboration, rate the interaction using the star system. Your feedback helps others gauge the quality of connections, while also helping to build your own reputation in the community.

**4. Grow Your Network:** As you engage with others, skillsX recommends more potential connections based on Cosine Similarity. 

**5. Update Your Profile:** Keep your profile up-to-date with your latest achievements, skills, or interests. This allows other users to see your growth and stay current on your expertise.

# Ideate

üé® **UI/UX Feature Concepts**

**1. Skill Cards with Layers**
Interactive, modular "skill cards" that show core skills and expandable ‚Äúside skills.‚Äù

Color-coded or tag-based for quick scanning.

Let users endorse or comment with context (e.g., "Great at breaking down complex ideas!").

**2. Connection Quality Score**
A ‚Äúsignal strength‚Äù metric based on mutual interests, shared goals, and interaction quality.

Not based on how many people they know ‚Äî but how aligned they are with you.

**3. Reputation Badges & Community Ratings**
Badges earned through peer reviews, mentorship activity, or verified projects.

Community can give feedback on helpfulness, communication, reliability, etc.

**4. Swipe-to-Scan Networking**
Like a Tinder for skills ‚Äî users can swipe through profiles or micro-stories based on interest and alignment.

Preview core skills, mutual goals, and last activity.

CTA: "Request a 15-min chat" or "Follow for content"

**5. Feedback Loop UI**
After collaborations or chats, prompt both users to leave a short review.

Ratings go into private growth analytics and public reputation.

**6. Skill Story Feature**
Let users share 1-2 minute stories on how they learned a skill, what they built, or how they helped someone.

Builds authenticity and connects over experience rather than titles.
