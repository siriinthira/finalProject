# SkillsX
SkillsX is an app prototype that combines networking, knowledge-sharing, and personal growth into one seamless experience. 

🚀 **Project Goals**

These goals guide what the product aims to achieve in the market and for its users.

Foster meaningful professional and skill-based relationships

Build a community that helps users connect with people who truly align with their goals and values.

Bridge the mentorship gap for students and early-career professionals

Make it easy for emerging talent to connect with experienced mentors.

Create a trusted space for self-improvement and feedback

Support users in developing soft skills and self-awareness through peer feedback.

Enable continuous personal growth through skill tracking

Encourage users to keep profiles updated and reflect on their progress.

Differentiate from traditional networking apps

Provide real value through relevance, interaction quality, and discovery of non-mainstream skills.

Leverage AI (e.g., Cosine Similarity) to improve user experience

Use intelligent matching to surface meaningful connections without overwhelming the user.

# 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 How it Works:

**1. Create a Profile:** Start by creating a personal profile that outlines your skills, interests, and background. The more detailed and up-to-date your profile is, the better you’ll connect with others who share similar or complementary expertise.

**2. Search and Connect:** Use the search function to find individuals who match your interests, skills, or career goals. You can easily send a message or start a conversation to explore potential collaboration opportunities or gain advice.

**3. Interact and Rate:** After engaging in a conversation or collaboration, rate the interaction using the star system. Your feedback helps others gauge the quality of connections, while also helping to build your own reputation in the community.

**4. Grow Your Network:** As you engage with others, skillsX recommends more potential connections based on Cosine Similarity. 

**5. Update Your Profile:** Keep your profile up-to-date with your latest achievements, skills, or interests. This allows other users to see your growth and stay current on your expertise.

🧩 **User Scenario: Korn’s Use of SkillsX**

Context:

Korn is prepping a digital campaign for a travel brand and wants to collaborate with a designer who understands cultural nuance and modern design. He also wants to mentor upcoming marketers and build his personal brand beyond Instagram.

Journey on SkillsX:

Discovery: Korn logs into SkillsX and uses the “Swipe-to-Scan” feature to explore collaborators with shared creative interests and complementary skills.

Matching: He sees Natthida’s profile — her Thai-modern visual style aligns with his campaign’s vibe. Her profile includes a Skill Story video where she breaks down her creative process for a past campaign.

Quick Check: He taps on her Skill Card, which reveals tags like “Brand Identity,” “Cultural Design,” and “Digital Illustration,” along with endorsements and a ⭐ 4.8 collaboration rating.

Connect: He uses the “Request a 15-min Chat” button to set up a virtual coffee.

Post-Collab: After collaborating on the campaign, Korn and Natthida exchange feedback through the platform, boosting each other’s reputation badges.

Outcome:

Korn finds a reliable design partner and earns credibility points as a collaborator and mentor. He later shares a Skill Story about the campaign success, attracting more relevant connection requests.



🧩 **User Scenario: Natthida’s Use of SkillsX**

Context:

Natthida is looking to break out of her current circle and work with more clients who understand the value of cultural storytelling. She’s also curious about mentoring juniors and learning more about digital marketing strategies.

Journey on SkillsX:

Profile Setup: Natthida builds a dynamic profile with a visual portfolio slider, embedded Skill Stories, and selects interest tags like “Cultural Branding” and “Creative Collaboration.”

Exploration: She browses the “Skill Visibility” feed, where short clips and posts from professionals like Korn appear. She finds his post on campaign storytelling insightful and follows him.

Connection: Korn reaches out for a collab. She reviews his Connection Quality Score, mutual interests, and reads positive peer feedback. She accepts the chat.

Growth: After the project, she receives a detailed review of her communication and visual delivery. She earns a “Collaborator Plus” badge and gets invited to a feedback circle with other creatives.

Reflection: Inspired by the experience, she posts her own Skill Story — "Blending Tradition with Trend: My Design Philosophy" — which gets positive engagement and leads to more interest from aligned collaborators.

Outcome:

Natthida elevates her visibility, builds cross-disciplinary connections, and enhances her credibility — all while staying true to her creative values.

# Ideate

🎨 **UI/UX Feature Concepts**

**1. Skill Cards with Layers**
Interactive, modular "skill cards" that show core skills and expandable “side skills.”

Color-coded or tag-based for quick scanning.

Let users endorse or comment with context (e.g., "Great at breaking down complex ideas!").

**2. Connection Quality Score**
A “signal strength” metric based on mutual interests, shared goals, and interaction quality.

Not based on how many people they know — but how aligned they are with you.

**3. Reputation Badges & Community Ratings**
Badges earned through peer reviews, mentorship activity, or verified projects.

Community can give feedback on helpfulness, communication, reliability, etc.

**4. Swipe-to-Scan Networking**
Like a Tinder for skills — users can swipe through profiles or micro-stories based on interest and alignment.

Preview core skills, mutual goals, and last activity.

CTA: "Request a 15-min chat" or "Follow for content"

**5. Feedback Loop UI**
After collaborations or chats, prompt both users to leave a short review.

Ratings go into private growth analytics and public reputation.

**6. Skill Story Feature**
Let users share 1-2 minute stories on how they learned a skill, what they built, or how they helped someone.

Builds authenticity and connects over experience rather than titles.

**Views**: UI screens categorized into features (e.g., chat, filters, profile, recommendations.


**Widgets**: Reusable UI components to ensure consistency and reduce duplication.


**Helpers**: Utility functions for validation, constants, and the recommendation engine logic (cosine similarity).


**Main Files**: firebase_options.dart for Firebase configuration and main.dart as the app’s entry point.
